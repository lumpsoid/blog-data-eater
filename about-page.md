title: About me

I am a data eater, and I absolutely love everything related to data. To me, data is delicious, and I can't get enough of it. I pour over data sets and revel in finding new insights and connections. My love for data is all-consuming. I am excited to share my passion for data with others, and I am always eager to learn from my peers in the field.

Here at this blog I cover a variety of topics including Python, work with BigData, Linux, and many other things related to delicious data.

I started my data eating from data analyst and data scientist. As passtime making small project on python, like some scripts for more comfort data eating or trying to parse every data in the world.

As for arch linux I usualy run into problems when documentation of various projects/modules is partly missing and configuring them results in the data is pouring out of me. Because of that I would like to write some guild and tldrs for those interested.

Here.. It is a data soup. It is delishious. Don't be afraid. Enjoy your meal.
