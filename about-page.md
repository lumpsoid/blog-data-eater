I am a data eater, and I absolutely love everything related to data. To me, data is delicious, and I can't get enough of it. I pour over data sets and revel in finding new insights and connections. My love for data is all-consuming. I am excited to share my passion for data with others, and I am always eager to learn from my peers in the field.

Here at this blog I cover a variety of topics including Python, workflow with BigData, Linux, and many other things related to delicious data.
